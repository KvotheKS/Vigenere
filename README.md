### HOW TO USE

The program receives variable arguments:

* <original_word> <cipher_word> -> <key>
* <key> <cipher_file.txt> -> <deciphered_text>

* <language> <cipher_file.txt> <output_file.txt> <min_key_size> <max_key_size> <amoung_guesses_per_key> -> <output_file.txt> 
	In this case, we are guessing the key used in encrypting the currently ciphered file. The output file contains guesses and an acompanning
	deciphered text.
